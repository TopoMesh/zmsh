*zmsh* is a software library for creating and transforming [cell complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex) and for computing [cellular homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_homology).
This project is an experiment in finding new ways to work with topological spaces in the hope of improving how mesh generators work.

### Reading

This project is based on concepts from algebraic topology.
At most universities this subject is graduate-level curriculum and written about accordingly, but I think we could go a long way towards making it more accessible.
If you want to read more about the math, my favorite books on the subject are:

* [A Combinatorial Introduction to Topology](https://store.doverpublications.com/0486679667.html) by Michael Henle
* [Graphs, Surfaces and Homology](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511779534) by Peter Giblin

Some good references on meshing are:

* [Delaunay Mesh Generation](https://www.routledge.com/Delaunay-Mesh-Generation/Cheng-Dey-Shewchuk/p/book/9781584887300) by Cheng, Dey, and Shewchuk
* [Triangulations and Applications](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-33261-8) by Hjelle and DÃ¦hlen
* [Polygon Mesh Processing](https://www.routledge.com/Polygon-Mesh-Processing/Botsch-Kobbelt-Pauly-Alliez-Levy/p/book/9781568814261) by Botsch and others
