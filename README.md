*zmsh* is a software library for creating and transforming [cell complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex) and for computing [cellular homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_homology).
This project is an experiment in finding new ways to work with topological spaces in the hope of improving how mesh generators work.

### Reading

This project is based on concepts from algebraic topology.
At most universities this subject is graduate-level curriculum and written about accordingly, but I think we could go a long way towards making it more accessible.
If you want to read more about the math, my favorite books on the subject are:

* [A Combinatorial Introduction to Topology](https://store.doverpublications.com/0486679667.html) by Michael Henle
* [Graphs, Surfaces and Homology](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511779534) by Peter Giblin
* [Elementary Applied Topology](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/notes.html) by Robert Ghrist
